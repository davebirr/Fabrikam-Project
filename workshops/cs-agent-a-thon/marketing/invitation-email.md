## Email Content:

**Subject: 🤖 Ready to build the future? Agent-A-Thon is calling your name!**

Hey [Team/Everyone],

Remember when we all thought building AI was rocket science? Plot twist: it's actually more like really smart LEGO blocks now. 🧱✨

**What:** Agent-A-Thon - A choose-your-own-adventure AI building workshop  
**When:** Thursday, November 6th at 8:15 AM  
**Where:** [LOCATION TBD]  
**Who:** You (hopefully!) + 100 other brave souls  
**Why:** Because saying "I built an AI agent" at parties is way cooler than "I attended another meeting"

## 🎯 Here's the deal:

Pick your poison:
- **🎮 Easy Mode:** Build a customer service hero (perfect for beginners)
- **🧠 Challenge Mode:** Create a sales intelligence wizard 
- **🚀 Beast Mode:** Architect a multi-agent executive assistant ecosystem

Choose your weapon:
- **Copilot Studio** (click, type, drag, done)
- **Semantic Kernel** (.NET developers, this one's for you)
- **Microsoft Agent Framework/LangChain** (Python enthusiasts, unite!)

## 🏆 What you'll walk away with:
- A working AI agent (yes, actually working!)
- Bragging rights that last until the next tech trend
- Real skills you can use Monday morning
- Stories to tell your grandkids about "the old days when humans built AI"

## 🎪 The best part?
We're running this on a **live business simulation**. While you're building, fake customers are placing real orders, warranty claims are pouring in, and the virtual Fabrikam empire is bustling with activity. It's like a video game, but for your career.

**No experience required.** Seriously. If you can order coffee from an app, you can build an AI agent.

*P.S. - Spots are filling up faster than a ChatGPT response. Don't be the person who watches everyone else become AI wizards while you're still trying to figure out why your printer is sentient.*

*P.P.S. - Coffee and snacks provided. Because building the future requires proper caffeine levels.*

Cheers,

Hey team!

Quick question: Want to build an AI agent in 2 hours and actually have fun doing it?

**Details:** Thursday, November 6th at 8:15 AM | [LOCATION TBD]

**Snacks:** Provided (because coding requires fuel)

Three paths, one goal: Leave with a working AI agent that would make ChatGPT jealous.

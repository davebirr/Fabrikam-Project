# 🎯 Agent-A-Thon: Your Fabrikam Adventure Awaits!

**Subject:** 🚀 You've been hired by Fabrikam (virtually) - Action Required!

---

Hey **{{RealFirstName}}**! 👋

Surprise! You've just been hired by Fabrikam Modular Homes! Well, virtually. And for one day. But hey, corporate culture is corporate culture.

Welcome to the Agent-A-Thon! For November 6th, you're **{{FictitiousName}}** - a valued employee at Fabrikam in our live business simulation. Think of it as the most elaborate roleplay since your company offsite trust falls.

## 🏢 Your Team Assignment

**You're on Team {{Team}}** 🎉

**📍 Thursday Morning (Nov 4):** Look for **Table {{TableNumber}}**  
Your table will have a tent card with your team name and all your teammates' fictitious names. Grab a seat with your crew - you'll be working together all workshop!

**👥 Your Teammates:**
{{TeamMatesList}}

## 🔐 Your Secret Identity (AKA Workshop Credentials)

**Workshop Username:** `{{WorkshopUsername}}`  
**Cover Story:** You work at `fabrikam1.csplevelup.com`  
**Challenge Level:** {{ChallengeLevel}}

### 🔑 Getting Your Temporary Password (The Spy Game)

Plot twist: Microsoft's email security is *too good* and blocks me from sending passwords via email. So here's the secret handshake:

**📱 Send me a Teams chat:**
> "Hey David! I need my workshop password for {{WorkshopUsername}}"

I'll reply with your temporary password. Think of it as a digital dead drop, but with fewer trench coats. 🕵️

⚠️ **You'll change this password on first login anyway** - Fabrikam has security standards, obviously.

## ✅ Your Pre-Workshop Mission

### 🎨 Step 1: Create Your Alter Ego's Browser Profile
**Pro tip:** Skip the InPrivate/incognito hassle. Create a dedicated Edge profile for {{FictitiousName}}. Future you will thank present you.

**The 60-second setup:**
1. Open Microsoft Edge
2. Click your profile icon (top right) → **Other profiles** → **Set up new work or school profile**
3. Choose an account (ignore any you may see) → **Add new account**
4. Choose **Sign in to sync data** and use your workshop credentials
5. Pick a fun theme so you always know which reality you're in! 🎨

📚 **Need the manual?** [Edge Profile Documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/sign-in-and-create-multiple-profiles-in-microsoft-edge-df94e622-2061-49ae-ad1d-6f0e43ce6435)

**🔧 Troubleshooting: Edge keeps signing you in as your real identity?**

Some Edge profiles have a setting called "Automatic profile switching" that tries to be helpful but causes chaos when juggling multiple identities. Here's the fix:

1. In your {{FictitiousName}} Edge profile, go to: `edge://settings/profiles`
2. Scroll to **Profile preferences**
3. **Turn OFF**: "Automatic profile switching"
4. Restart Edge

This prevents Edge from auto-switching you back to your real account when visiting Azure/M365 sites.

**😤 Still having issues? InPrivate works too!**

If Edge profile switching is giving you grief and you don't want to mess with settings, using **InPrivate/Incognito mode** is totally fine. It's less convenient (no saved passwords, new window each time), but it works reliably. Your call! 🤷‍♂️

### 🔑 Step 2: First Login & MFA Dance
**Do this BEFORE Thursday morning!**

1. Head to: [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) or [https://mysignins.microsoft.com](https://mysignins.microsoft.com)
2. Sign in as {{FictitiousName}} (not your real identity!)
3. Set up MFA (authenticator app or phone - your choice)
4. Create a password you'll actually remember (you'll need it on Day 1!)

### 🤖 Step 3: Verify Your Superpowers
1. Visit: [Copilot Studio](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com)
2. Look for the Fabrikam environment (it should be there, waving at you)
3. Verify you can access agent-building tools
4. Feel the power! ⚡

## 🎯 What Happens on Workshop Day?

- **📅 Day 1 (Nov 4):** Find your table, meet your team, start building AI agents!
- **📅 Day 2 (Nov 5):** Continue building, present your solutions, celebrate wins!
- **🏆 All Days:** Learn, collaborate, and have fun with cutting-edge AI tech!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting for When Technology Hates You

**Can't login?**  
→ Double-check you're using the **workshop tenant** (fabrikam1.csplevelup.com), not your Microsoft corp tenant. (Yes, we've all done it.)

**Password rebellion?**  
→ Try the password reset flow or ping David Bjurman-Birr on Teams for backup.

**MFA giving you grief?**  
→ Make sure you're setting up MFA for {{FictitiousName}}, not your real account. (Again, we've all been there.)

**Can't find your table Thursday morning?**  
→ Look for the tent card with "Table {{TableNumber}} - Team {{Team}}" and your teammates' names. We got you!

## 🔒 Secret Agent Stuff

Once you get your password via Teams and complete setup, you can delete that Teams message. Your temporary password is like a superhero's secret identity - keep it safe, then destroy the evidence. 🔐

**Important:** Please complete Steps 1-3 **BEFORE Thursday morning** so you're ready to hit the ground running. MFA setup during the workshop = sad face. MFA setup beforehand = happy face! 😊

See you Thursday at Table {{TableNumber}}! 🎭

*P.S. - Pro move: Practice introducing yourself as {{FictitiousName}} to your bathroom mirror. Or don't. We're not judging.* 😎  
*P.P.S. - Actually, maybe don't do that. But DO come prepared to have fun!*

**Subject:** ⏰ Agent-A-Thon Password - Get it now or lose precious coffee time Thursday!

Hey **{{RealFirstName}}**! 👋

Quick heads-up from your friendly neighborhood infrastructure guy...

## ⚠️ The Thursday Morning Scenario I'm Trying to Avoid

**7:30 AM - Thursday Morning:**
- You arrive eager for coffee ☕
- You want to socialize with colleagues 🤝
- Maybe grab a pastry 🥐
- Then smoothly transition into building awesome AI agents 🤖

**What MIGHT happen instead:**
- You realize you never got your workshop password 😬
- You send me a Teams message 📱
- Along with 47 other people who also waited until the last minute 😅
- My Teams stops responding from the password request deluge 💥
- You're sitting at your table trying to login while everyone else is building agents 😢
- That coffee is getting cold ☕❄️

## 🎯 The Solution (Takes 30 seconds!)

**Send me a Teams chat RIGHT NOW:**

> "Hey David! I need my workshop password for {{WorkshopUsername}}"

I'll reply with your temporary password. Then you can:
1. ✅ Set up your Edge profile (if you haven't)
2. ✅ Do your first login
3. ✅ Complete MFA setup
4. ✅ Create a memorable password
5. ✅ Show up Thursday ready to BUILD instead of troubleshoot

## 📊 Current Status

**Passwords already claimed:** ~3 out of 119 participants  
**Passwords still unclaimed:** ~116 (including yours!)  
**David's Thursday morning stress level if this doesn't change:** 📈📈📈

## 🚀 Why Do This Now?

- ⏰ **Save 10-15 minutes Thursday morning** (that's one whole demo!)
- ☕ **Protect your coffee/networking time** (priorities!)
- 🧠 **One less thing to think about** on workshop day
- 🤝 **Save my sanity** (my Teams app thanks you)
- 🏆 **Be the prepared person** at your table who helps others

## 🎯 What You Need

Just send that Teams message! That's literally it. I'll reply with your password, you do a quick setup, and you're golden.

**Full setup guide:** See the original email or ping me if you need it!

**Looking forward to seeing you Thursday - passworded and ready to go!** 🎉

*P.S. - If you already have your password and completed setup, you're a hero! Feel free to ignore this email while smugly sipping your coffee Thursday morning.* ☕😎

*P.P.S. - Seriously though, please don't wait until 7:45 AM Thursday. My Teams app is already nervous.* 😅

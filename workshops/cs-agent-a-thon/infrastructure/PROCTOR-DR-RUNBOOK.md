## üö® **Failure Scenarios & Recovery Procedures**

### **Scenario 1: Copilot Studio Outage** üî¥
**Recovery Time Objective (RTO): 5 minutes**

#### **Symptoms:**
- Participants report "503 Service Unavailable" in Copilot Studio
- Cannot create or edit agents
- Tools not responding in Copilot interface

#### **Diagnosis:**
```powershell
# Test primary Copilot Studio
Test-NetConnection copilotstudio.microsoft.com -Port 443

# Check Azure Service Health
Get-AzureADServiceHealth | Where-Object { $_.Service -eq "CopilotStudio" }
```

#### **Recovery Steps:**
1. **Announce Failover** (Proctor Lead):
   ```markdown
   üö® ATTENTION ALL PARTICIPANTS üö®
   
   We are experiencing issues with Copilot Studio in the primary environment.
   Please switch to the backup environment immediately:
   
   NEW COPILOT STUDIO URL:
   https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com/?tenant=26764e2b-92cb-448e-a938-16ea018ddc4c
   
   Bookmark this URL and refresh your browser.
   All your work is preserved in the backup tenant.
   ```

2. **Verify Backup Accessibility**:
   - All proctors test backup Copilot Studio URL
   - Confirm participants can access backup environment
   - Monitor Teams chat for participant issues

3. **Document Incident**:
   ```powershell
   # Log failover event
   Add-Content -Path ".\workshop-incident-log.txt" -Value @"
   [$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss')] FAILOVER EXECUTED
   Scenario: Copilot Studio Outage (Primary Tenant)
   Action: Switched all participants to backup tenant
   Backup Tenant ID: 26764e2b-92cb-448e-a938-16ea018ddc4c
   Proctor: $env:USERNAME
   "@
   ```

---

### **Scenario 2: Azure Subscription Quota Exceeded** üü°
**Recovery Time Objective (RTO): 15 minutes**

#### **Symptoms:**
- "Quota exceeded" errors when deploying resources
- Participants cannot create new Azure resources
- Existing resources work but scaling fails

#### **Diagnosis:**
```powershell
# Check quota usage
Connect-AzAccount -TenantId "fd268415-22a5-4064-9b5e-d039761c5971"
Get-AzVMUsage -Location "eastus" | Where-Object { $_.CurrentValue -ge ($_.Limit * 0.9) }

# Check OpenAI quota
Get-AzCognitiveServicesAccountUsage -ResourceGroupName "rg-agentathon-team-01"
```

#### **Recovery Steps:**
1. **Request Emergency Quota Increase**:
   ```powershell
   # Create support ticket
   New-AzSupportTicket `
       -Name "Workshop Emergency Quota" `
       -Severity "A" `
       -ProblemClassificationId "/providers/Microsoft.Support/services/quota" `
       -Title "Agent-A-Thon Workshop - Emergency Quota Increase"
   ```

2. **Activate Backup Subscription** (if quota increase > 30 min):
   ```powershell
   # Switch participants to backup subscription
   Connect-AzAccount -TenantId "26764e2b-92cb-448e-a938-16ea018ddc4c"
   
   # Verify backup subscription has capacity
   Get-AzVMUsage -Location "eastus"
   ```

3. **Announce Subscription Switch**:
   ```markdown
   üì¢ ATTENTION ALL PARTICIPANTS üì¢
   
   We are switching to our backup Azure subscription due to capacity limits.
   
   ACTION REQUIRED:
   1. Log out of Azure Portal
   2. Log back in at: https://portal.azure.com
   3. Switch directory to backup tenant (top-right dropdown)
   4. Your team resource group name remains the same
   
   Copilot Studio URL UNCHANGED - no action needed there.
   ```

### **Scenario 3: Complete Tenant Failure** üî¥üî¥üî¥
**Recovery Time Objective (RTO): 30 minutes**

#### **Symptoms:**
- Cannot authenticate to primary tenant
- All Azure services unreachable
- Copilot Studio returns authentication errors
- Azure Portal shows "Tenant not found"

#### **Diagnosis:**
```powershell
# Test tenant reachability
Connect-AzAccount -TenantId "fd268415-22a5-4064-9b5e-d039761c5971" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

if ($Error[0] -match "AADSTS50034") {
    Write-Host "üö® PRIMARY TENANT DOWN - FULL FAILOVER REQUIRED" -ForegroundColor Red
}

# Verify backup tenant health
Connect-AzAccount -TenantId "26764e2b-92cb-448e-a938-16ea018ddc4c"
.\infrastructure\scripts\Test-WorkshopReadiness.ps1
```

   - Verify every participant can access backup environment
   - Document any participants with access issues
   - Assist with directory switching in Azure Portal

4. **Incident Documentation**:
   ```powershell
   # Comprehensive incident report

   Zero failover events - Successful DR planning validated
   "@
   ```

2. **Participant Feedback**:
   - Survey participants on access experience
   - Document any "wrong tenant" issues encountered
   - Note effectiveness of bookmark strategy

3. **DR Lessons Learned**:
   - What worked well?
   - What could be improved?

   - How effective was proctor coordination?

4. **Cleanup Verification**:
   ```powershell

   .\infrastructure\scripts\Remove-WorkshopResources.ps1 -WhatIf
   
   # Review resources to be deleted
   # Execute cleanup after approval
   ```

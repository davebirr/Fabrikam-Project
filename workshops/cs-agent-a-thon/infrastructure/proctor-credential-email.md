# 🎯 Agent-A-Thon: Your Proctor Alter Ego Awaits!

**Subject:** 🚀 You're officially a Fabrikam employee (sort of) - Action Required!

---

Hey **{{RealFirstName}}**! 👋

Plot twist: You've been hired by Fabrikam! Well, virtually. And temporarily. But still pretty cool.

Welcome to the Agent-A-Thon proctor squad! For the next few weeks, you're **{{FictitiousName}}** - one of Fabrikam's finest employees in our live business simulation. Think of it as method acting, but for AI workshops.

## 🔐 Your Secret Identity (AKA Workshop Credentials)

**Workshop Username:** `{{WorkshopUsername}}`  
**Cover Story:** You work at `fabrikam1.csplevelup.com`

### 🔑 Getting Your Temporary Password (The Spy Game)

Plot twist #2: Microsoft's email security is *too good* and blocks me from sending passwords via email. So here's how we do the secret handshake:

**📱 Send me a Teams chat:**
> "Hey David! I need my workshop password for {{WorkshopUsername}}"

I'll reply with your temporary password. Think of it as a digital dead drop, but less dramatic. 🕵️

⚠️ **You'll change this password on first login anyway** - Fabrikam has security standards, obviously.

## ✅ Your Mission (Should You Choose to Accept It)

### 🎨 Step 1: Create Your Alter Ego's Browser Profile
**Pro tip:** Skip the InPrivate/incognito hassle. Create a dedicated Edge profile for {{FictitiousName}}. Future you will thank present you.

**The 60-second setup:**
1. Open Microsoft Edge
2. Click your profile icon (top right) → **Other profiles** → **Set up new work or school profile**
3. Choose an account (ignore any you may see) → **Add new account**
4. Choose **Sign in to sync data** and use your workshop credentials (if you're wondering what that is, re-read this email)
5. Pick a fun theme so you always know which reality you're in! 🎨

📚 **Need the manual?** [Edge Profile Documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/sign-in-and-create-multiple-profiles-in-microsoft-edge-df94e622-2061-49ae-ad1d-6f0e43ce6435)

**🔧 Troubleshooting: Edge keeps signing you in as your real identity?**

Some Edge profiles have a setting called "Automatic profile switching" that tries to be helpful but causes chaos when juggling multiple identities. Here's the fix:

1. In your {{FictitiousName}} Edge profile, go to: `edge://settings/profiles`
2. Scroll to **Profile preferences**
3. **Turn OFF**: "Automatic profile switching"
4. Restart Edge

This prevents Edge from auto-switching you back to your real account when visiting Azure/M365 sites.

**😤 Still having issues? InPrivate works too!**

If Edge profile switching is giving you grief and you don't want to mess with settings, using **InPrivate/Incognito mode** is totally fine. It's less convenient (no saved passwords, new window each time), but it works reliably. Your call! 🤷‍♂️

### 🔑 Step 2: First Login & MFA Dance
1. Head to: [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) or [https://mysignins.microsoft.com](https://mysignins.microsoft.com)
2. Sign in as {{FictitiousName}} (not your real identity!)
3. Set up MFA (authenticator app or phone - your choice)
4. Create a password you'll actually remember!

### 🤖 Step 3: Confirm Your Superpower Access
1. Visit: [Copilot Studio](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com)
2. Look for the Fabrikam environment (it should be there, waving at you)
3. Verify you can access MCP connectors and agent-building tools
4. Feel the power! ⚡

## 🆘 Troubleshooting for When Technology Hates You

**Can't login?**  
→ Double-check you're using the **workshop tenant**, not your Microsoft corp tenant. (Yes, we've all done it.)

**Password rebellion?**  
→ Try the password reset flow or ping David Bjurman-Birr for backup.

**MFA giving you grief?**  
→ Make sure you're setting up MFA for {{FictitiousName}}, not your real account. (Again, we've all been there.)

## 🔒 Secret Agent Stuff

Once you get your password via Teams and complete setup, you can delete that Teams message. Your temporary password is like a superhero's secret identity - keep it safe, then destroy the evidence. 🔐

See you on the other side of reality! 🎭

*P.S. - Method acting tip: Try introducing yourself as {{FictitiousName}} in your next meeting. Report results.* 😎  
*P.P.S. - Just kidding. Maybe don't do that. Unless it's funny. Use judgment.*

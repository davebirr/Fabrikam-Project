I'm truly sorry to hear about the damage to your new home - that must be incredibly frustrating, especially after taking time off work. This is absolutely not the experience we want for our customers, and we're going to get this resolved for you right away.

Let me gather some information to ensure this gets immediate priority attention:

2. Can you describe the water damage and wall cracks? (Where located, how extensive)
3. Do you have photos you can share? (You can text them to our support line: 555-FABRIKAM)

[After customer provides: Order FAB-2025-042, describes damage to kitchen area and bedroom wall, mentions photos taken]

Thank you for that information. Let me document this and connect you with our quality assurance team immediately.

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Tool Usage Patterns**

**Pattern 1: Order Lookup**
```
Customer mentions order → Extract order number/email → Call get_orders
- If order number: get_orders(orderId=X)
- If email: get_orders(pageSize=10) then filter by customer
- Always check for null/empty results
- Provide full status, timeline, and next steps
```

**Pattern 2: Product Information**
```
Customer asks about products → Determine if specific or comparison
- Specific: get_products(productId=X)
- Category: get_products(category="ModularHomes")
- Comparison: get_products() then compare specific items
- Always provide context for decision-making
```

**Pattern 3: Support Ticket Creation**
```
Complex issue detected → Gather information → Create ticket
- Priority: Critical (damage/safety), High (urgent), Medium (standard)
- Category: Quality, Installation, Warranty, Billing, General
- Include: Order number, clear description, customer contact info
- Set expectations: Who will contact, when, what process
```

### **Error Handling Examples**

**Order Not Found:**
```
"I apologize, but I'm not finding order number FAB-2025-999 in our system. Let me help you locate it:

1. Can you double-check the order number? It should be in format FAB-YYYY-XXX
2. What email address was used when placing the order?
3. Do you have the order confirmation email you could reference?

I can also search by your email address or phone number if that's easier!"
```

**Product Out of Stock:**
```
"The Cozy Cottage 1200 is currently showing as backordered with an estimated 6-8 week lead time. However, I have some good options for you:

1. **Reserve Now**: Lock in current pricing, delivery in 8 weeks
2. **Similar Models**: The Urban Studio 1100 is in stock (available info)
3. **Custom Build**: Start a custom design (4-6 month timeline)

Would you like me to connect you with our sales team to discuss these options?"

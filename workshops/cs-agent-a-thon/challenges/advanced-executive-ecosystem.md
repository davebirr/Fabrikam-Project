- üåä **Information Overload**: Data from 15+ business systems, but no synthesis
- üîÆ **Reactive Management**: Problems discovered after they become crises
- üèóÔ∏è **Siloed Decisions**: Departments optimizing locally, not globally
- ‚ö° **Speed of Business**: Strategic decisions needed in hours, not days
- üéØ **Strategic Blind Spots**: Missing connections between data points

### **Your Multi-Agent System Should**
- üß† **Think Strategically**: Connect business events across departments
- üîç **Monitor Continuously**: Proactive identification of risks and opportunities
- ü§ù **Coordinate Responses**: Orchestrate actions across business functions
- üìä **Synthesize Intelligence**: Executive-level insights from operational data
- üö® **Predict and Prevent**: Strategic early warning system

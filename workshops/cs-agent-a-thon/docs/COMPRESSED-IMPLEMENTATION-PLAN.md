---

## ‚è∞ **Timeline Reality Check**

### **Week of Oct 28 - Nov 1: IMPLEMENTATION SPRINT**
- **Monday-Wednesday**: Core implementation
- **Thursday-Friday**: Testing with proctors
- **Weekend**: Final bug fixes

### **Week of Nov 4-6: CS OFFSITE + WORKSHOP**
- **Monday-Wednesday**: CS Offsite (minor tweaks only)

---

## üéØ **CRITICAL PATH - Must Have**

### **üî¥ Priority 1: Core Workshop Foundation (Mon-Tue)**

#### **1. Minimal Viable Infrastructure**
```yaml
Essential Only:
  - Single Azure subscription (skip multi-tenant complexity)
  - 5 Fabrikam instances (20 participants per instance)
  - B2B guest access (skip native user backup)
  - Basic monitoring (skip advanced dashboards)

Resource Allocation:
  Instance A01: Teams 1-4 (20 participants)
  Instance A02: Teams 5-8 (20 participants)  
  Instance A03: Teams 9-12 (20 participants)
  Instance A04: Teams 13-16 (20 participants)
  Instance A05: Teams 17-20 (20 participants)
```

#### **2. Essential Business Simulator**
```csharp
// Minimum viable business simulator
public class WorkshopSimulatorService : BackgroundService
{
    protected override async Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
    {
        while (!stoppingToken.IsCancellationRequested)
        {
            // Generate 1 order every 5 minutes during workshop
            await GenerateSimpleOrderAsync();
            
            // Generate 1 support ticket every 7 minutes
            await GenerateSimpleTicketAsync();
            
            await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5), stoppingToken);
        }
    }
}
```

#### **3. Workshop Management API**
```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/workshop")]
public class WorkshopController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpPost("start")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> StartWorkshop()
    {
        // Enable fast simulation mode
        _config.WorkshopMode = true;
        return Ok("Workshop mode activated");
    }
}
```

---

### **üü° Priority 2: Participant Experience (Wed)**

#### **1. Simplified User Management**
```powershell
# Single script for B2B invitations
$Participants = 1..100 | ForEach-Object { "participant$_.ToString('D3')@microsoft.com" }
$Teams = @("A01", "A02", "A03", "A04", "A05")

$ParticipantIndex = 0
ForEach ($Email in $Participants) {
    $TeamIndex = [Math]::Floor($ParticipantIndex / 20)
    $Team = $Teams[$TeamIndex]
    
    # Simple B2B invitation
    New-AzureADMSInvitation -InvitedUserEmailAddress $Email `
        -InviteRedirectUrl "https://fabrikam-$Team.azurewebsites.net"
        
    $ParticipantIndex++
}
```

#### **2. Team Assignment Matrix**
```yaml
Simplified Team Structure:
  Instance A01 (20 people): General customer service scenarios
  Instance A02 (20 people): Sales intelligence scenarios  
  Instance A03 (20 people): Executive assistant scenarios
  Instance A04 (20 people): Mixed difficulty scenarios
  Instance A05 (20 people): Advanced/experimental scenarios
```

---

### **üü¢ Priority 3: Proctor Testing (Thu-Fri)**

#### **1. Proctor Validation Checklist**
```markdown
Essential Tests (30 minutes per proctor):
‚òê B2B guest login works
‚òê Copilot Studio access verified
‚òê Can create basic customer service agent
‚òê Fabrikam API connectivity confirmed
‚òê Support tickets appear in queue
‚òê New orders generated during session
‚òê Agent can handle realistic scenarios
```

#### **2. Workshop Day Runbook**
```markdown
7:00 AM - Infrastructure health check
7:30 AM - Enable workshop simulation mode
8:00 AM - Final proctor briefing
8:15 AM - Workshop begins
8:30 AM - All participants building (success metric)
```

---

## üìã **SIMPLIFIED Architecture**

### **Infrastructure Decisions (Final)**
```yaml
Tenant Strategy: Single tenant (reduce complexity)
Instance Count: 5 instances (20 participants each)
User Management: B2B only (no backup plan)
Monitoring: Basic health checks only
Deployment: Manual + simple scripts (no full automation)
```

### **Technology Stack (Locked)**
```yaml
Participants Choose From:
  - Copilot Studio (click, type, drag, done)
  - Semantic Kernel (.NET developers)
  - Microsoft Agent Framework (Python enthusiasts)
  - LangChain (Alternative Python option)
```

## üéØ **Success Criteria (Minimum)**

### **Technical Minimums**
- ‚úÖ 5 Fabrikam instances running and accessible
- ‚úÖ B2B guest access working for all participants
- ‚úÖ Copilot Studio agent creation confirmed
- ‚úÖ Basic business simulation generating content
- ‚úÖ Workshop start/stop controls functional

### **Participant Experience**
- ‚úÖ Login to building agent < 5 minutes
- ‚úÖ Fresh scenarios available throughout workshop

- ‚úÖ Proctors know how to troubleshoot common issues
- ‚úÖ Workshop day runbook tested and validated
- ‚úÖ Backup plans for critical failure scenarios

---

## üö® **Risk Mitigation**

### **High-Risk Items**
```yaml
B2B Guest Access Issues:
  Mitigation: Test with 10 real @microsoft.com accounts
  Backup: Manual account creation day-of
  
Copilot Studio Permissions:
  Mitigation: Test guest user agent creation
  Backup: Pre-created agents participants can modify
  
Infrastructure Overload:
  Mitigation: Load test with 20 concurrent users per instance
  Backup: Reduce participants per instance if needed
```

### **Day-Of Contingencies**
```yaml
Authentication Issues:
  - Have proctor accounts ready for sharing
  - Pre-created agents as backup starting points
  
Performance Issues:
  - Scale up App Service plans immediately
  - Redirect participants to least-loaded instances
  
Content Issues:
  - Manual ticket/order injection if simulator fails
  - Pre-prepared scenario list for proctors
```

‚ùå Full automation scripts (manual + simple)
‚ùå Warranty department simulator (basic only)
‚ùå Advanced scenario triggers
‚ùå Real-time analytics dashboard
```

‚úÖ Core business simulator (orders + tickets)
‚úÖ Three workshop challenge paths
‚úÖ B2B guest access for 100 participants

‚úÖ Team collaboration (20 per instance)
‚úÖ Realistic business scenarios
```

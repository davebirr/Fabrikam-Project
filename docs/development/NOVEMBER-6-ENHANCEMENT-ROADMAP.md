# üöÄ November 6th Agent-a-thon Enhancement Roadmap
**Repository Organization & Feature Development Plan**

---

## üìã **Current State Assessment**

### **‚úÖ Strengths**
- **Solid Foundation**: Robust API architecture with authentication and testing
- **Read Operations**: Complete GET endpoints with filtering, pagination, analytics
- **MCP Integration**: Working read-only tools for customer service, sales, executive scenarios
- **Data Models**: Well-structured entities (Customer, Order, Product, SupportTicket)
- **Authentication**: Dual strategy (Entra ID + ASP.NET Core Identity)

### **‚ùå Critical Gaps**
- **CRUD Limitations**: Missing POST/PUT/DELETE endpoints for all entities
- **Static Experience**: No automated business simulation - participants see same data
- **Limited MCP Tools**: Read-only capabilities prevent agents from taking actions
- **No Dashboard**: Participants can't visualize their agent's impact
- **Basic Sample Data**: Unrealistic product catalog, limited customer personas

# 🧹 Repository Cleanup & Enhancement Plan
**October 26, 2025 - Repository Organization for November 6th Agent-a-thon**

---

## 📋 **Current Repository Health Assessment**

### **✅ Well Organized Areas**
- **Archive Structure**: Good separation of old files in `/archive/`
- **Project Structure**: Clean separation of API, MCP, Contracts, and Tests
- **Workshop Content**: Comprehensive workshop materials in `/workshops/cs-agent-a-thon/`
- **Documentation**: Good organization in `/docs/` with clear categories
- **Scripts**: Helpful utility scripts in `/scripts/`

### **🎯 Areas for Enhancement Focus**
- **Sample Data Quality**: Current data is basic, needs realistic business scenarios
- **API Capabilities**: Missing CRUD operations for interactive workshop experience
- **MCP Tool Capabilities**: Limited to read-only, needs action capabilities
- **Real-time Features**: No business simulation or live dashboard

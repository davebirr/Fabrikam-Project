## üìä **Key Findings & Assessments**

### **Current Repository Strengths**
```yaml
Well-Organized Structure:
  ‚úÖ Clean separation of API, MCP, Contracts, and Tests
  ‚úÖ Comprehensive workshop materials in place
  ‚úÖ Good documentation organization
  ‚úÖ Effective archive system for old files

Solid Technical Foundation:
  ‚úÖ Robust read-only API with filtering and analytics
  ‚úÖ Working MCP integration with authentication
  ‚úÖ Comprehensive test coverage for existing features
  ‚úÖ Dual authentication strategy (Entra ID + ASP.NET Core)
```

### **Critical Gaps for Workshop Success**
```yaml
Missing CRUD Operations:
  ‚ùå No POST/PUT/DELETE endpoints for any entities
  ‚ùå Participants can't create tickets or update orders
  ‚ùå MCP tools limited to read-only operations
  ‚ùå No way for agents to take meaningful actions

Static Experience:
  ‚ùå No automated business simulation
  ‚ùå Same scenarios every time participants log in
  ‚ùå No progressive complexity or variety
  ‚ùå No real-time feedback on agent effectiveness

Limited Engagement:
  ‚ùå No dashboard to visualize impact
  ‚ùå No gamification or team competition
  ‚ùå No way to measure workshop success
  ‚ùå Basic sample data lacks realism
```
